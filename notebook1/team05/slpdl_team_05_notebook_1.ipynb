Nevertheless -just to satisfy your curiosity- they are:\n","* Resampling based on distance to the focus word. See [Efficient Estimation of Word Representations in Vector Space](https://arxiv.org/abs/1301.3781) section 3.2:\n","> Since the more distant words are usually less related to the current word than those close to it, we give less weight to the distant words by sampling less from those words in our training examples.\n","* Hierarchical softmax.
