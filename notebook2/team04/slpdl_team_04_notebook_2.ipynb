This allows use to create mini-batches easily: if we have $n$ color images of size $w \\times h$, each image is represented by a tensor of shape [3, w, h] (the \"3\" is because a color image is normally represented with 3 channels: red, green and blue), so we just stack the $n$ images together into a tensor of shape `[n, 3, w, h]`. Therefore, because we have input data of the same size, creating batches is easy.\n","\n","**How are text sentences fed to neural machine translation (NMT) or text classification networks?** In these cases, each piece of input data is a sequence of tokens, where each token is an integer number, normally the index of the token in the vocabulary table. Each sentence can have a differnt length. In order to compose a mini-batch, we make all sentences in the batch artificially longer, to match the length of the longest sentence. In order to do that, we will each sentence to the right with a special \"padding token\". For instance, if we want to pad a sentence of length 5 to fit in a batch where the maximum sequence length is 8, we need to add 3 padding tokens to the right of the last token in the sentence.\n","\n","Now, **how are text sentences fed to language models?** It would be possible to do the same as with NMT/text classification networks, but that's not the usual way to do it. Why? Because that way we would not be using the context from the previous sentences to make the next token predictions. In order to be able to profit from previous sentences' information, we do as follows: we concatenate all sentences together in a single long super sequence (the boundary between sentences is normally marked with an &lt;EOS&gt; token) and then, we create the batches so that they include $n$ fragments of fixed-length text so that they are \"connected\" to the $n$ fragments from the previous batch that we gave to the network. This means that the piece of fixed-length text at position $k$ in a batch is the continuation of the sentence at position $k$ in the previous batch. To actually be able to use the context from the previous batch in the predictions of the current batch, the last hidden states of the previous batch are used as initial hidden states for the current batch. The propagation of the gradients between different batches is severed, though. This is called \"**truncated back-propagation through time**\" (T-BPTT).

Instead, we always use as input the real tokens from the training data $y_i$. This is normally called \"**teacher forcing**\".

now use our trained language model to actually generate text.

Remember from the beginning of the notebook that our LM actually is modeling the probability distribution of a token conditioned on the previous ones, right?: $p\\left(y_t|  y_1, \\ldots, y_{t-1} \\right)$ . So at each time step, we have a categorical probability distribution (i.e. the probability for the next token to be each of the possible tokens in our vocabulary). How do we obtain a token from a probability distribution over the token space? There are many ways but the most straightforward ones are:\n","\n","* Greedily: taking the most probable token (i.e. the token with highest probability, normally with `torch.argmax`).\n","* Sampling: drawing a random sample from the categorical distribution, normally done with `torch.multinomial`.\n","\n","This way, we will predict the next token with one of the techniques above. Then, we will use this prediction as input for the next prediction, and so on. This is called \"**auto-regressive**\" inference.\n","\n","Nevertheless, we will not start from scratch. Instead, we will give the LM a piece of text (the \"context\") to be used as starting point, and then the LM should generate the following text.\n","\n","First of all, we need a function that performs over the same preprocessing over the context text that we performed for the training, validation and test data at the beginning of the notebook (normalization, tokenization and lowercasing), so that we can use it as input for our network:"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"S-1xLXPq8dhm","colab_type":"code","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":136},"outputId":"a3b2dbfc-78ac-433e-8e25-0263d92dcecf","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1587987809814,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":1161,"user":{"displayName":"Roser Batlle Roca","photoUrl":"","userId":"17655797919868920403"}}},"source":["model.eval()"],"execution_count":55,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["LanguageModel(\n","  (embedding_dropout): Dropout(p=0.3, inplace=False)\n","  (rnn_output_dropout): Dropout(p=0.3, inplace=False)\n","  (embedding): Embedding(30000, 600)\n","  (rnn): LSTM(600, 600, num_layers=2, dropout=0.3)\n","  (projection): Linear(in_features=600, out_features=30000, bias=True)\n",")"]},"metadata":{"tags":[]},"execution_count":55}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"zt_SrwjOSEK9","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":["#model = LanguageModel(len(idx2token), embed_dim=300, hidden_dim=300, num_layers=2).cuda()\n","model.load_state_dict(torch.load('checkpoint.pt'))\n","\n","from sacremoses import MosesTokenizer, MosesDetokenizer, MosesPunctNormalizer\n","\n","normalizer = MosesPunctNormalizer()\n","tokenizer = MosesTokenizer(lang='en')\n","\n","def text2token_ids(token2idx, unk_token_id, text):\n","    # TODO: implement the same preprocessing as with the\n","    #       train/valid/test datasets, using sacremoses programmatic API\n","    #       (normalization, tokenization, lowercasing).
